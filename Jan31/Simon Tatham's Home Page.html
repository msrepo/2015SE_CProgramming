<b>Malware warning</b>: I know of two suspicious and probably
malicious pieces of Windows software that have been seen in the wild,
which falsely cite my name in their version information:
<ul>
<li>one first seen in May 2011, which apparently <b>does not use the
same name twice</b>. For example, I've heard of it under the names
&#8216;<code>JeCodec</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code>Cwazia</code>&#8217;,
&#8216;<code>klitey2</code>&#8217;, &#8216;<code>afiloa</code>&#8217;
or just &#8216;<code>q2</code>&#8217;, <b>but it could be called lots
of other things too</b>.
<li>one calling
itself &#8216;<code>GoldG</code>&#8217;, seen in October 2010.
</ul>
If you encounter any program claiming to be written by me, and you
can't find it on this web site (and I didn't personally give it to you
by some other means), then it might well be a trojan or virus of some
kind. Don't trust it!

<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>: a general

</li><li>
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/mp/">Metaprogramming custom control structures in C</a>:
another piece of C preprocessor abuse to let you build quite general
user-defined looping constructs alongside C's basic <code>for</code>

<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/aliases.html">Magic Aliases</a>: a dirty trick you can do
by combining aliases and shell functions in the Bourne shell.
</li><li>
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/infinity.html">The Infinity Machine</a>: an exercise in
what you might call "recreational computer science", inspired by Ian
Stewart. Explores the potential consequences if an infinitely fast
computer could be built (including defining precisely what that
means).
</li><li>
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/cdescent/">The Descent to C</a>: an introduction to C for
people coming to it from higher-level languages, intended to warn you
in advance about the likely culture shocks.
</li><li>
My experience of <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/svn.html">migrating to Subversion</a>.

My personal FAQ about the fact that I have
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/smell.html">no sense of smell</a>.
